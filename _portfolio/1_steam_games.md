After developing mobile games and assets for years, I started pc game development around 2020. 
What I like most about pc game development is the large commitment to a single project, 
and building something that I'm proud of by combining design, programming and artistic skills.

* Managing large project structure
* Planning
* Keeping focus over time, working consistently 
* Game design (mainly designing an engaging gameloop)

<i>2021, September 2024 - current</i>

Formbound is a third-person shooter where you play as a squishling; a parasitic alien species.
You use human hosts to fight other humans, trade, build your ship and travel to new locations.
The goal is to reach the space station where your brother is held, and free him.
