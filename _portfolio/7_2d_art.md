I've always enjoyed drawing and sketching, and for Walter Walnut dabbled into Photoshop 2D art for the first time.
Below are some examples of my 2D art.

## Storyboard screens

Originally I was going to use these for storytelling, but I decided not to use them.

## Character icons

Cute goofy looking character icons I drew for Walter Walnut.

## Video thumbnails

Not sure if this counts as 2d art, but I design my own YouTube thumbnails. Below are two examples.
