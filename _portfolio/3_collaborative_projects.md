Game Challenge show on YouTube where a number of developers pass one single game project and work on it without any communication.
Challenge is to find out what other developers intended to do with the game, and build upon that.

* Challenging to work with existing projects
* Got my own motion capture suit
* Kicked off the 5 vs 5 competition

<i>Team size: 1 at a time, consecutively</i>
