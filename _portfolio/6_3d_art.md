I enjoy making my own 3d assets and specialize in (colorful) stylized 3d art. 
I generally go for a smooth shaded low poly look.
Also I enjoy making my own shaders to create custom lighting, effects and bring my models to life and create a consistent look.

Below are some examples of 3D models I've made, divided over subcategories.

## Environments

Here are some in-engine environments that combine models, post processing, lighting and shaders.

## Low poly characters

Here are some low poly animal characters mostly from Walter Walnut.
