# Hi! I'm Thijmen Schoonbeek 
<b>aka Codeer </b>



I'm a game and asset developer with a bachelor's in software development. 
While programming is my forte, I’m passionate about a wide range of creative projects, from game development to 2D art, video editing, and wildlife photography. 
I’m always open to new opportunities — <i>feel free to get in touch!</i>
